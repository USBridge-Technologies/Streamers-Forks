/**
 * The on-mount cadence (`components/stagger.tsx`).
 *
 * Here because "the stagger does not run" has now been reported three times and the failure is
 * invisible in a screenshot — a flattened group and a staggered one are identical once they
 * settle. Judge these by watching, or by sampling opacity mid-entrance.
 *
 * `AfterLoading` records something worth keeping: a group that mounts half a second late, the way
 * a query resolves, still staggers. A child mounting into an ancestor already in `enter` runs its
 * own `from → enter`. So arriving after the page is NOT by itself what breaks a group, and `root`
 * is not the reflex for it — a portal or a tab panel is.
 *
 * Both of these must stagger. Storybook wraps every story in a `<Section>`, so a story cannot tell
 * you whether the real page has an ancestor driving at all; that part only shows up in the app.
