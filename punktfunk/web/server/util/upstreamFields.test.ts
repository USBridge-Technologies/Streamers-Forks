// The password-gated BFF routes rebuild their upstream body from a field whitelist, so anything
// they forget to list is silently dropped on the way to the host. That is invisible from the
// console — the request succeeds, the setting just never lands — and it is exactly how
// `until_disconnect` shipped as a no-op once already.
//
// So: every property the OpenAPI request schema defines must be named in the route that forwards
// it. Textual on purpose — importing an h3 route pulls in nitro's globals, and the thing worth
// pinning is the whitelist, not the handler.
