//! The render-side D3D11 device the swap-chain processor binds to the IddCx swap-chain.
//!
//! The D3D/DXGI types are the `windows` crate (refcounted COM, no manual Drop); the swap-chain/LUID
//! hand-off to the wdk-sys IddCx world happens via raw pointers in `swap_chain_processor.rs`.
//!
//! Binding this device to the swap-chain keeps the monitor a live display, and the frame publisher
//! reuses its immediate context in `CopyResource` on each swap-chain processor thread. The device is
//! POOLED across processors (one per render LUID, [`pooled_device`]), so two live monitors' worker
//! threads share it concurrently — creation must NOT pass `D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_SINGLETHREADED` (sound
//! only pre-pooling, device-per-processor), and the immediate context is `SetMultithreadProtected`
//! (it has no internal locking of its own).
