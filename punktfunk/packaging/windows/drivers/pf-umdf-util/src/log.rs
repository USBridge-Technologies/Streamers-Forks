//! The bring-up file log every punktfunk UMDF driver keeps, in one place.
//!
//! Four drivers had a byte-identical copy of this, and `pf-mouse` recorded what that costs: the
//! world-writable-path hardening of security-review 2026-07-28 reached three of them and missed
//! the fourth. Landing it here means the next such fix cannot miss a driver.
//!
//! The path is the decision worth owning. WUDFHost's own (LocalService) temp dir — never
//! `C:\Users\Public`, where a non-admin could pre-create or hold the file, or read diagnostics
//! that carry per-pad identity material. The whole sink is OPT-IN besides: a release driver
//! writes nothing unless its knob is set, so neither the file nor the debugger trap exists on a
//! player's machine. DebugView cannot see a UMDF host across session 0, which is why the file is
//! the bring-up diagnostic at all.
//!
//! Each driver keeps its own gate — the env name is its own, and `pf-vdisplay`'s also reads the
//! machine registry — and hands it in as a `fn` pointer.
